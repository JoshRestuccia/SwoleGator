# SwoleGator
CEN3907C Design Project - SwoleGator 


## Pre Alpha Build

- choosing and ordering hardware 
  - pro con list added to design draft
  - datasheets for esp32 wroom and imu are added to this repository
   
- Steps to program ESP32 
  - download arduino ide
  - download "windows drivers" (not universal) from https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads and install with x64.exe file
  - download board to arduino ide with this tutorial https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/
  - use examples from files/examples

- Testing ESP32
  - hello world complete and functional!
  - LED blink complete and functional!
  - discovering wifi and bluetooth networks successful!
 
- Testing IMU
 - examples/imu can be used to plot accelerometer data from imu to esp32
 - coutputs accelerometer data to phone app "thunkable"
