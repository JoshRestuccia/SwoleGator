## Usability
### Interface
All interface elements have been implemented and are accessible. At this point, the UI is entirely contained in the software elements, with an intuitive app that is able to connect to the hardware remotely. The app has a simple login and usage interface, with clear buttons and responses as with any other app. In addition, persistent state is evident in the highlight of buttons (such as the ESP32 once it hs been connected remaining a darker color) and pages on the app such as the graphing consistently sending calls in order to update and display data.
### Navigation

## Build Quality 
### Robustness
No major crashes or glitches are apparent in this build. The app connects to Bluetooth for an extended period of time and is able to continuously receive and store data, as well as display the data on the app screens.
### Consistency
There is consistency in the software aspects of logins and app behavior in our build. The app will predictably find our device to connect to, and only our app. The hardware aspect is calibrated with each use to ensure consistency in measurements from sensors.
